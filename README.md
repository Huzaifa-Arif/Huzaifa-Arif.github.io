Hi My name is Huzaifa Arif and I am a third year PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My advisor is [Dr. Alex Gittens](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~gittea/).




## Research Interests

My primary research focus is on Trustworthy Machine Learning within federated settings. I have contributed to research in model reprogramming, group fairness, and adversarial attacks on foundation models. Currently, I am developing algorithms to address data leakage in these models. If your research interests align with mine, please feel free to reach out.
