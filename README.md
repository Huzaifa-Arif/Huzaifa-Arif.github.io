Hi My name is Huzaifa Arif and I am a third year PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My advisor is [Dr. Alex Gittens](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~gittea/). I am currently looking for internship roles.


## Research Interests

My primary interests are in Trustworthy Machine Learning in Federated Setting. I am currently working on projects related to fairness in federated learning and data leakage in foundation models from a theoretical standpoint. I am also open to collaborations.Please reach out to me for collaboration.
